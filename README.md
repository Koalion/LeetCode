# LeetCode
Gathering of solutions for Leetcode problems. The problems can be found here: https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/
To structure the repository in some organized manner, I decided to use Leetcode "Featured Lists" as the baseline. The folder structure follows the hierarchy of:
- Name of the Leetcode list
  - Name of the language in which the questions are solved
    - Files with the question itself (description + solution)
